Hi, I’m Sudin Neupane, a fresh graduate from grade 12 in the Computer Science stream, where I achieved a GPA of 3.52. I’m a passionate programmer with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, C, and SQL, along with a growing proficiency in JavaScript. My journey in programming has been driven by a desire to build impactful and efficient solutions, and I’m always eager to expand my knowledge and skill set.

Currently, I’m delving deeper into JavaScript to enhance my ability to create dynamic and interactive web applications. As I continue to grow as a developer, I’m excited to take the next step by exploring React, a powerful framework that I believe will help me elevate my development skills and contribute to creating modern, user-friendly web interfaces.

I’m actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on projects that challenge me, push my boundaries, and help me grow. I’m particularly interested in working on meaningful and productive projects where I can apply what I’ve learned, while also learning from others in the process. Whether it’s contributing to a small task or participating in larger projects, I’m enthusiastic about working with like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology.
